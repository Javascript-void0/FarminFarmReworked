# 🍞 FarminFarm

FarminFarm is a Minecraft Server Hosted on [Minehut](https://minehut.com). It was run by me and my amazing staff team 😄. Now the server is being run by Hollow, a close friend. 🙏The players focused on building automated farms that gradually grew. The builds can be viewed through the Discord server, or downloading the worlds below. The server featured a GUI shop, ingame ranks, Server Prestige and Rankup system, special tools/items, amazingly build spawns 🌆, and an inflated economy 💸.
